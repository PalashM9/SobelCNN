# CNN Edge Detection with Sobel Filters

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for edge detection in images using predefined Sobel filters. The notebook is designed as a learning trial to illustrate how simple CNNs can be used to highlight edges in images, providing a foundational understanding of edge detection mechanisms in the field of computer vision.

## Overview

Edge detection is a critical preprocessing step in many computer vision tasks, helping in object detection, feature extraction, and image segmentation. This notebook employs Sobel filters, one of the most widely used methods for edge detection, to identify horizontal and vertical edges in images.

## Features

- **Sobel Filter Implementation:** Understand how Sobel filters can be manually defined and applied to images for edge detection.
- **CNN with PyTorch:** Utilize PyTorch's neural network module to create a CNN model that applies Sobel filters to detect edges.
- **Image Visualization:** Visualize the original images alongside their edge-detected counterparts for a comprehensive comparison.
- **Customization:** Learn how to adjust the Sobel filters and CNN model to experiment with different types of edge detection.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.8+
